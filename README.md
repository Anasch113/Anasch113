I'm Anas Rafiq, a passionate software developer with a strong focus on building scalable AI and full-stack web solutions that solve real-world problems through automation. My work is driven by a deep interest in innovation, system thinking, and clean code. I enjoy working on challenging problems and turning complex ideas into practical, impactful applications.

As a Level 2 Seller on Fiverr, I've delivered a wide range of solutions to clients across the globe, from medium to large-scale applications. Whether it’s building AI-powered chatbots, integrating third-party APIs, or developing seamless frontends with modern frameworks, I always aim for quality and long-term value.

My journey into software development began with curiosity and has since evolved into a purpose-driven career. I believe in constant learning, clear communication, and writing maintainable code. I enjoy collaborating with clients and teams who share a vision for meaningful, efficient, and modern technology.

Previously, I interned at [Codsoft](https://www.codsoft.in/), where I gained hands-on experience with professional workflows and development practices. Now, I lead and contribute to projects that combine my skills in AI, backend development, and interactive user experiences.
